This was a project done during my time in the boot camp offered by Code Academy Berlin and was taking place between the 19th of february until the 2nd of march.

This project was about analysing the chemical components of a red wine and a white wine dataset. The goal was to explore the data and build a classification Machine Learning
model to classify the wines into red or white wine based on their chemical composition. In the end the findings were presented in a final presentation.

This repository includes the python codes and my presentation.

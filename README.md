This was a project done during my time in the boot camp offered by Code Academy Berlin and was taking place between the 19th of february until the 2nd of march.

This project was about analysing the chemical components of a red wine and a white wine dataset. The goal was to explore the data in regards to what influences the quality of a wine. The second task was  to build a classification Machine Learning model that classifies wines into red or white based solely on their chemical composition. In the end the findings were presented in a final presentation.

You can find the dataset here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality

This repository includes the coding for data exploration + ML Model (.ipynb-file) and my final presentation.
